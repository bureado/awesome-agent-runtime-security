 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Agents shouldn't [process arbitrary inputs, communicate externally, and access private data](https://ai.meta.com/blog/practical-ai-agent-security/) simultaneously. 
Various projects focus on proving the integrity of tools, tool descriptions, models, data sources, and provenance by combining isolation, [sandboxing](https://github.com/SAFE-MCP/safe-mcp/blob/main/mitigations/SAFE-M-9/README.md), security observability, and [server-constrained](https://github.com/SAFE-MCP/safe-mcp/blob/main/mitigations/SAFE-M-31/README.md) or client-bound tokens. This repo was originally inspired by [this listicle](https://gist.github.com/bureado/71dfb7380e8a1cd7294c2f8b8136d085).

Other tools of potential interest include:

**Containers and Linux namespaces**: [ExitBox](https://github.com/Cloud-Exit/ExitBox) (Docker/Podman with Squid proxy, credential vault, and per-access approval prompts), [code-sandboxes](https://github.com/datalayer/code-sandboxes) (unified API across four isolation tiers), [nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw), [yolobox](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox), [agentbox](https://github.com/rcarmo/agentbox), [construct-cli](https://github.com/EstebanForge/construct-cli), and [ctenv](https://github.com/osks/ctenv) all rely on standard Linux container isolation. [try](https://github.com/binpash/try) and [usand](https://github.com/richfelker/usand) use Linux namespaces via `unshare` to let commands run in a contained environment. [nsjail](https://nsjail.dev/) is Google's lightweight process isolation tool combining Linux namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp-bpf. [sandbox (Cloudflare)](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox) provides a seccomp library for syscall filtering. [systemd's exec security settings](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html) and [setpriv](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/master/sys-utils/setpriv.1.adoc) serve as convenient declarative frontends for composing namespaces, seccomp, and capabilities.

**Bubblewrap**: [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) is the foundational unprivileged sandboxing tool — using Linux user namespaces without requiring root — that backs several projects above. It can be applied directly to [Claude Code](https://patrickmccanna.net/a-better-way-to-limit-claude-code-and-other-coding-agents-access-to-secrets/) or [OpenCode](https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/ai-agent-sandbox/), with [nixwrap](https://github.com/rti/nixwrap) providing a Nix-declarative wrapper and [sandbox-run](https://github.com/sandbox-utils/sandbox-run) a minimal CLI around it.

**Landlock**: [Landlock](https://landlock.io/) is a stackable LSM for unprivileged filesystem and network restriction. [island](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/island) is the official Landlock project sandbox tool. [landrun](https://github.com/Zouuup/landrun) and [rstrict](https://github.com/creslinux/rstrict) are small CLI tools for restricting process access without root. [Litterbox](https://litterbox.work/) combines Landlock with Linux namespaces, and [Cursor Agent Sandboxing](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-sandboxing) uses Landlock directly in production (with Seatbelt on macOS and WSL2 on Windows), noting 40% fewer approval interruptions after teaching agents about their sandbox constraints.

**WASM and browser-grade isolation**: [langchain-sandbox](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-sandbox) and [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) bring Python into WASM for sandboxed agent code execution; [RLBox](https://rlbox.dev/) provides WASM-based library sandboxing for isolating untrusted components within a process; [wassette](https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/concepts.html) applies WASM at fine-grained component boundaries. [V8 Isolates](https://blog.cloudflare.com/safe-in-the-sandbox-security-hardening-for-cloudflare-workers/) offer a lightweight per-request isolation model as an alternative to containers or VMs.
